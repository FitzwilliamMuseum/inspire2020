> 'Right from the start Sophie was interested in cupids wings and the details from the focus painting.  She wanted to use chalk to experiment on a different canvas like the painting was on wood.  Sophie had her own idea that she would like to be part of the art and arranged herself in the photo shoot with her work and told us how she wanted the photo taken.'
‘I am interested in the painting because there are so many things happening in it’ Sophie  age 9
