>'Year 1 focused on the painting in their English lessons. First they painted a background in shades of blue, and then named items in a house shape â€“ this linked with their topic work on houses and where we live. Then they filled in speech bubbles of charcaters in the painting, working out what they would say to eachother to practice vocabulary.'
