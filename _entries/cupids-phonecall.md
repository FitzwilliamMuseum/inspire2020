> 'Twenty-five children from Year 3 at Great and Little Shelford Primary School took part, first exploring the painting using role play and diary entries. They were most fascinated by the scene in which Psyche lifts Cupid's wing to reveal him. This led us to dress a mannequin for the Village Phone box as Cupid and filling it with conversations they thought might happen between the two. We imagined what Cupid would say to Psyche if he telephoned her and then displayed the dialogue in the village phone box and in the village newsletter.â€™
