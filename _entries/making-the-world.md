>'Year 2 teachers and trainee teachers set aside a one morning, using a hall space and large pieces of cardboard with wax crayons and pastels as the media.  The children worked in groups to draw life-sized cut-outs of Cupid and Psyche, and to also make some of the other physical parts of the world of the painting â€“ trees, the high mountain, the Oracle, the two homes. Finally, the children had the chance to enter the world, and to become some of the characters, posing for photographs.'
