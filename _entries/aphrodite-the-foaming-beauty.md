> ‘Going to the Fitzwilliam really inspired me that art isn’t just a thing: it’s emotion -it shows how the painter feels, and that museums are magical places. It gives people the chance to experience history and to make memories.’  Matilda
'Matilda and Ameila were really inspired by the Greek goddesses and decided to focus on Aphrodite.  They both have a love of fashion.  The clothing from paintings and the statues at the museum really inspired them to create this painting with their own design.  They liked the idea of using chalks and create a large piece of art on a different surface.'
