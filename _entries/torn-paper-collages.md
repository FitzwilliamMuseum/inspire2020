> 'Year 4 spent time gathering their ideas on how they could explore the painting.  They decided to use torn paper collage, as it reminded them of the Roman mosaics they had seen as part of their topic work. Some of the children brought in magazines and scraps of special paper to use. They worked in groups on different close-ups from the painting.'
