‘Our Reception class looked at the painting 'Cupid and Psyche' as part of a whole school 'Big Draw'.  We then talked about the people who they love and who love them no matter what they do.  The children suggested lots of different people including their mummy, daddy, brother, sister, grandparents and their school buddy! The children used collage techniques to create a picture of their chosen person.​’​
