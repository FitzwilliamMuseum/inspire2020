> ‘I remember the first day of art club… Our ideas  started off as small seeds and now it’s grown into a  huge tree.’

Daisy-Mae, aged 10, St Laurence Catholic Primary School


> 'Using the story of Cupid and Psyche as our inspiration, we decided to re-tell the story of our school. As we had recently celebrated our 50th anniversary, we wanted our project to reflect our own history. Inspired by the trees in the landscape, we used the imagery of the anniversary tree we had planted together to symbolize our flourishing school community growing from the roots up. Pupils interviewed past and present teachers, students and parents to collect memories that are represented as collages. We combined many different art techniques to create this whole-school project including gold leaf and beautiful tapestries that ‘book-end’ the painting. We framed our tree with embroidered curtains for a similar effect.'
