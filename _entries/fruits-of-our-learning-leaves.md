> 'In September 2019, the pupils who attended the original Inspire 2020 museum session were inspired by the gold leaf del Sellaio used. They wanted their leaves on the school art installation to be gold too.  We found gold cards in our art cupboard that were perfect! Every student was set the individual task of designing their own golden leaf for our tree.'
