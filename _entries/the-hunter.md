> 'Jack was inspired by the story ‘comic’ element of the focus painting.   He enjoys reading and watching comics and used this as inspiration to create his own about a hunter.  His finished piece was a comic book with the same character repeating though out based on a Greek hunter god.  He focused on telling the story through his illustrations on each page.'

During his trip to the museum Jack said  ‘I like to write notes down so I remember what I have seen and learnt today’
