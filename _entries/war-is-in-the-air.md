> 'Harry and Jacob were fascinated by the painting being painted on wood  so experimented with using a different canvas, which le d them to use cardboard.  They wanted to keep Cupid’s wings but combined him with another ancient god, Mars. They wanted their object to be  practical like the fans they saw in the museum, so they decided to  make it into a badge.' ​
