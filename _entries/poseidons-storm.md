> 'After listening to the Greek myth in the painting Leland and Antoni researched more about other Greek gods. They learnt about the god Poseidon. They were inspired by their visit to the museum where they learnt to observe the backgrounds in painting to create mood.  They worked hard on their own painting backgrounds to create the stormy mood.'
