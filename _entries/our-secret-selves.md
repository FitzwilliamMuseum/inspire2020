>‘The pupils were drawn to one corner of the painting - Psyche lifting Cupid’s wing. With the title “My Secret Self” we discussed what someone would see if they lifted our wing to reveal our own secret selves- a side to us that maybe no-one else knows about. We thought about what we would secretly choose to be doing instead of going to school- what activity would truly reflect who we really are? The pupils then painted a miniature portrait of themselves engaged in this activity and made paper feathers to form two large wings to hide their secret selves.'

Mrs Rosamund Ashton and Mrs Dawn Scott, Year 3 Class Teachers
