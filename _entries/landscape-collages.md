> 'Pine Class were inspired by the landscape in painting of Cupid and Psyche, especially the detail and colours the artist used to paint the trees and sky. This led to a discussion about how different weather and seasons could be represented using colour. The children explored this by depicting thunderstorms, hot days and windy days using oil pastels, paint and collage.

> The children were learning about habitats in science and so for their final piece, created a landscape of their chosen habitat. They used colour and texture to represent the weather and elements of this habitat, with a specific focus on the sky.'
