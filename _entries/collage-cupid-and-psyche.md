> Squirrels Year 1 and 2 class at Wilburton Primary School researched the painting carefully, using role-play and comic strips to consider the narrative. After experimenting with mixed-media collage, and learning more about cassones as well as myths and legends, the class was eager to create a play or theatre. Their final piece are animations that use their shoe box theatres and puppet figures to tell their own stories.
