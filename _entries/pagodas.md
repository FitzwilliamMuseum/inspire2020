> Willow class liked the look of the Oracles temple in the painting, especially as our school pagoda  that looks similar is right outside our own classroom and we occasionally use it to enhance our learning. We started by sketching our own pagoda, but then got very sidetracked with zentangle patterns. Our final work included a bit of everything - we made 3D models as well, and enjoyed working on different colour blending activities along the way.
