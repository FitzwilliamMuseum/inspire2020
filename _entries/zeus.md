> Bartosz and Toby worked hard together on this project. They were interested in the Greek gods but decided to focus on Zeus as he is the most powerful. They wanted to use this project as an opportunity to experiment and learn a different and new medium of art.  
They enjoyed the challenge of the chalk and liked how they could draw on a large scale and blend the colours together.  
They took inspiration from the different sizes of art work at the museum and the different types of canvases used.   
‘I am most happy with ‘the floating ground’  because it looks like it has been lifted by the energy’ Bartosz  
‘I am most happy with the helmet as it has more colours and it is bold so everyone who looks at it will notice it.’ Toby
