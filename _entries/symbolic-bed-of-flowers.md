> 'We made a symbolic bed of flowers, which was assembled in the school entrance hall. Simple paper flowers were made by children and adults on our ‘Show Racism the Red Card’ day in school. On this day, we always look to make a big statement about standing up and speaking out against racism in our school and in our society.  We want our school to be a safe and happy space, and we thought that the bed of flowers could represent that intention; as Psyche was blown off the high mountain by the Zephyr, she landed safely.  We know that in our school community, we have adults and children who have had difficult times in their lives, and we all try to do our best to make sure that our school is a place where they feel safe and cared for.  Parents, carers, family members and friends were also able to make a flower at our half-termly tea in October, which were added into our flower bed.'
