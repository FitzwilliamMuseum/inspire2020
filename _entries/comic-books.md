Pen on paper


> In Sycamore, we explored how the painting of Cupid and Psyche, instead of capturing a scene like a photograph, told a story in one continuous cartoon-like picture. Initially, we investigated the narrative and discussed the themes and messages behind the story. This chimed nicely with our writing topic of fables, which also provide a message of wisdom to the reader. We started by exploring well know fables and looked how we could partition them in to a story board. We looked at the characters from our chosen fable and practiced drawing them with detail and shadows to add depth. Next we thought about the setting, which would need to provide a continuous background. For the final piece we put the two together to create our own story-picture.
