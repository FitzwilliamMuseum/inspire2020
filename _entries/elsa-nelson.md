‘After running a training session for staff based on the painting and activities from AccessArt we held a whole school assembly where we heard the story of how the painting was made, what it was used for, and then we heard the story of Cupid and Psyche as it is shown in the painting. Year groups and classes then engaged with the project in many different ways. After studying the painting at school we extended the offer of learning to families, inviting them to the museum. Comments from parents and carers underlined that they enjoyed having the chance to come along and learn about something the children were working on at school. Families were able to stay on, following our time with the painting, as part of the Museum’s monthly Family First event.' This drawing is Elsa Nelson, who captures the movement and the action of the characters perfectly.
