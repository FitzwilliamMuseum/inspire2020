> 'In Reception, our exploration of the painting began with looking at the painting in our Big Talk lesson, where we talk about what we can see, wonder and think… This led to lots of activities and adventures taking place within the children’s choosing time, where they explore their learning through play. We had lots of lovely role playing, with the children turning our wooden fort into an interpretation of the picture, as well as, using our dressing up clothes and material pieces to act out the characters that the children had observed. The painting also proved to be a great provocation for the children’s writing, both independently in their play and during teacher led sessions.'
