> Elm Class were inspired by the landscape in the background of the picture, possibly because it is so different to Cambridgeshire and what they know.

>They imagined they were in the painting at particular times in the story, looking out at what they could see (that is why there is different weather, fireworks etc).

>As a class we tried out lots of different materials, learning and experimenting about how to use them and the effects they could produce. Each child then created a final piece based on the materials they most enjoyed using.
