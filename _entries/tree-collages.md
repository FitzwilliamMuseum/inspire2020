> In Ash class, we noticed the number of trees that were within the painting of Cupid and Psyche. This led to a discussion of different tree shapes and an exploration of different ways of drawing trees. To do this, the children experienced using a range of different resources and techniques, such as collage and colour mixing.  
For their final piece, the children were able to choose their preferred method to create a tree picture. They all started by painting the sky in the background and adding their trees to this in stages.
