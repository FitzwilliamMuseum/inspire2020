>â€˜We started off by learning more about the painting of Cupid and Psyche and then focused on the cassone. The children liked the idea of giving a special gift to someone and we thought it would be nice to make our own version to give to a friend, as we are trying really hard to make and establish new friendships as we settle into our classes and school life.'
