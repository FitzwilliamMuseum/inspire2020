> 'Pupils created a quick collage of a  small section of the painting as a  warm up. This was an activity I had learnt on the training day. They each chose a small section of the painting to  reproduce. I modelled how to do this and  showed techniques such as tearing and  curling the paper.  ​Pupils then began a larger collage on A3 and  could choose from a range of a materials to  recreate a scene from the painting.'
