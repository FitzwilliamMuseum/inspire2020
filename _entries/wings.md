Mixed Media

> Cedar Class were inspired by the movement of the characters in the picture, particularly those with wings. We studied how different artists interpreted winged creatures including humans and the movement of wings. We then completed detailed studies of real feathers and wings using different mediums. The children were encouraged to look carefully at the shapes of different types of feathers and the structure of wings.
