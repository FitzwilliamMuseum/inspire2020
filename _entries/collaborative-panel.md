> 'The picture was introduced to the class by the Year 6 children who had been to the Fitzwilliam. Year 4 then retold the story in their own words. The project fitted with our English unit on ‘Twisted Fairy Tales’. The painting was used as the inspiration for the children’s own Twisted Fairy Tales which we joined together into one story. The class was divided into groups and worked together to plan out how they wanted their part of the story to appear. On the day of the Big Draw we worked with artist Jenny Duke, parents and art students to bringing our vision to fruition.’
