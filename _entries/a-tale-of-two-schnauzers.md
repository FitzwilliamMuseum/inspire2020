> ‘The class were first introduced to the painting of Cupid and Psyche in person upon their visit to the Fitzwilliam. Here they undertook a talk by a gallery teacher and then used their sketchbook to explore their understanding of the story and process behind the painting. In Literacy the painting inspired them to write their own stories which we would later base our finished artwork on. Once the class story was selected, the children commenced with dramatic retellings and using musical accompaniments to further immerse themselves in their learning. Finally they were ready to bring the story to life. They worked as a team and used a range of materials to create a collaging technique alongside a local artist, Ophelia Redpath, and various parent helpers from the local community to complete their finished artwork.’​​
