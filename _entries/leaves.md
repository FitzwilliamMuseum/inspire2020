Print on paper

> We looked at the painting of Cupid and Psyche and discussed all the different things we could see in it. We noticed the different trees and from this decided to choose the theme of ‘Leaves’ as our art project. We explored many different mediums including crayon rubbing, negative pastel prints and wool winding. As our final piece, we sketched a leaf from leaves collected in the playground. We then transferred this onto a polystyrene tile by pressing it through with a pencil. Now we painted the leaf tile and roller printed it on to our art paper. The children were amazed at how unique each others art work was, just like the leaves in nature.
