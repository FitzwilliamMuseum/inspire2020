Pastels, crayons and watercolours on paper


> Beech Class were inspired by the pattern on Psyche's quilt, namely the stars and the contrast of the bright yellow against the dark background. We took this further and developed the theme of stars and moons.  
This led to an investigation into the formation of symmetrical and asymmetrical shapes. We also studied 'Starry Night' by Van Gogh and looked at how stars are depicted using colour and technique and, in theory, the concept of impressionism.  
The children used pastels and crayons to create the stars and then painted a wash using watercolour. We enjoyed the fact that the stars shone through the dark wash!
