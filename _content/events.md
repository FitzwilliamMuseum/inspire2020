These pages describe teacher training sessions which took place during the exhibition which finished in March 2020

During these practical, hands-on CPD Sessions for Primary School Teachers, we will take a closer look at [Del Sellaio’s Cupid and Psyche](/focus), and celebrate how this remarkable Rennaisance panel inspired the creation of artworks by primary school pupils in Cambridgeshire, on display in the INSPIRE Exhibition in the Octagon Gallery from 10th December 2019 until 22nd March 2020.

Over the course of the exhibition, we will take a closer look at some of the themes and projects developed over the course of Inspire through a sereis of practical, hands-on sessions for teachers. We would be delighted to welcome back teachers, who participated in the INSPIRE2020 Project to share their experiences, as well as those who are new to the project. The sessions will demonstrate how museum collections can support and deepen learning in art and other subjects, and contribute to the development of a broad and balanced curriculum. They will be facilitated by the Fitzwilliam Education Team and AccessArt and co-led by participating teachers from the INSPIRE project.

£10 2- 5pm
