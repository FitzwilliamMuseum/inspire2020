**1 How do I book a visit for my class to visit the museum?**

Please contact our bookings team by calling 01223 332904 or [emailing us ](mailto:education@fitzmuseum.cam.ac.uk).

**2 My school can’t afford the cost of the coach. Can you help?**

We have a [travel bursary](/assets/burary.pdf) available for schools who might not otherwise be able to visit the museum, or for those with a high proportion of special needs and pupil premium students .

**3 I can’t visit the museum with my class. What resources are available to support my visit?**

This website has been designed to provide you with resources and images that you can use in the classroom. Please do contact us if you have any questions or need any additional information to help you with you teaching back in school.

**4 How will you decide what goes in the exhibition?**

When evaluating submissions we will ask:

* How has the focus object inspired your project?
* Is there evidence of pupil-led research and an investigative approach?
* What process have you been through?
* Have there been opportunities to learn new skills and techniques?
* What cross-curricular links have been made?
* Have you made any links with the wider community?

**5 What if I do all the work with my class, submit their work and then it is not accepted?**

We only have limited space available in the gallery so the selection process for the exhibition will be competitive, according to the selection criteria outlined in the CPD presentation. However, we are also planning to host an online INSPIRE2020 exhibition on the main Fitzwilliam Museum site to display examples of work from all schools that submit.

**I want to do the project with the current Year 6 class. Does it matter if they have left the school next year?**

No. The pupils do not have to still be at your school in December 2019.

**Can I link the project to an Arts Award?**

Yes! This is an excellent idea! If you are planning a visit to the museum let us know when you make your booking and we can incorporate this into your session. All our museum teachers are Arts Award trained.

**I can’t persuade my school to let me work with a whole class or year group on an art project like this. Can I run the project in my art club?**

Yes! Please do! It doesn’t matter if the project is with 4 or 400 children we just want to see how you and your group have been inspired by the focus painting.
